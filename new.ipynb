    "1. Data Quality Requirements\n",
    "✅ Completeness:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset should have minimal missing values.\n",
    "If missing values exist, decide whether to impute, drop, or handle them properly.\n",
    "✅ Consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure uniform formatting across features (e.g., gender should be \"Male/Female,\" not \"M/F/male\").\n",
    "No contradictory or duplicate records.\n",
    "✅ Accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure data is correct and free from errors.\n",
    "Validate against domain knowledge or external references.\n",
    "✅ Uniqueness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove duplicate records if they exist.\n",
    "Check for redundant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing\n",
    "✅ Handling Missing Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Impute missing values using mean, median, mode, or KNN imputation.\n",
    "Drop missing values if the percentage is too high.\n",
    "✅ Handling Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use boxplots or z-score methods to detect outliers.\n",
    "Consider log transformation or capping techniques.\n",
    "✅ Feature Scaling (Normalization or Standardization):\n",

    "Label Encoding (for binary categories).\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding (for nominal categorical features).\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding (for ordered categories).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Distribution & Transformation\n",
    "✅ Check for Skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "If features are right-skewed, apply log transformation.\n",
    "If features are left-skewed, use square-root or cube-root transformation.\n",
    "✅ Check for Kurtosis (Outliers Impact):\n",
    "\n",
    "If kurtosis is high, consider winsorization (capping extreme values).\n",
    "✅ Balance Target Variable (if classification task):\n",
    "\n",
    "If classes are imbalanced, apply oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. Feature Engineering\n",
    "✅ Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove highly correlated features (to avoid multicollinearity).\n",
    "Use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or Feature Importance (XGBoost, Random Forest).\n",
    "Use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) if needed for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "✅ Feature Creation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create new meaningful features (e.g., Ratios, Aggregations, Polynomial Features).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Splitting & Model Readiness\n",
    "✅ Train-Test Split:\n",
    "\n",
    "Split data into train (70-80%) and test (20-30%).\n",
    "✅ Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use K-Fold Cross-Validation (e.g., k=5 or 10) for better model evaluation.\n",
    "✅ Check for Data Leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure no information from test data is used in training (e.g., avoid imputing missing values using the entire dataset).\n",
    "Final Takeaway\n",
    "A well-processed dataset reduces bias, improves model accuracy, and ensures reliable predictions. Would you like a step-by-step"
